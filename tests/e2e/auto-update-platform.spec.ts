/**
 * E2E Test: Auto-Update Platform Logic
 *
 * Tests platform-specific auto-update behavior and restrictions.
 *
 * ## What's Tested
 * - Linux AppImage updates can be enabled (setAutoUpdateEnabled works)
 * - Platform mocking via devMockPlatform() API
 *
 * ## Coverage Gaps (Skipped Tests)
 * - **Linux non-AppImage restriction**: Skipped because UpdateManager.setEnabled()
 *   doesn't re-check shouldDisableUpdates() after the user sets the value.
 *   The platform restriction is only applied at startup, not on dynamic changes.
 *   This would require architecture changes to test properly.
 *
 * ## Equivalent Coverage
 * - Platform restriction logic is unit-tested in updateManager.test.ts
 * - The startup-time restriction behavior works correctly in production
 *
 * @module auto-update-platform.spec
