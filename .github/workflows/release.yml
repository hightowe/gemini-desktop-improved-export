# GitHub Actions Release Workflow
# =============================================================================
#
# This workflow handles the automated release process for Gemini Desktop.
# It triggers on version tags (v*), executing:
#   - Build (via _build.yml)
#   - Quality Gate Tests (via _test.yml, fail-fast enabled)
#   - Release Packaging & Publishing (via _release.yml)
#
# =============================================================================
