# GitHub Actions Manual Release Workflow
# =============================================================================
#
# This workflow allows manual triggering of the release process.
# It is useful for testing packaging or creating ad-hoc releases, executing:
#   - Build (via _build.yml)
#   - Release Packaging & Publishing (via _release.yml)
#   - SKIPS tests for faster execution
