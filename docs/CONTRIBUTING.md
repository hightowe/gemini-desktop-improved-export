## Style Guidelines

### TypeScript

- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Enable strict mode
- Prefer explicit types over `any`
- Use interfaces for object shapes

### React

- Functional components with hooks
- Keep components small and focused
- Use context for shared state

### Electron

- Follow the security checklist
- Use IPC for main ↔ renderer communication
- Keep the main process lean

### Commit Messages

Use clear, descriptive commit messages:

```
feat: add zen mode toggle
fix: resolve tray icon not showing on Linux
docs: update installation instructions
test: add e2e tests for quick chat
```

---

## Testing

We maintain high test coverage. Please add tests for new features.

### Running Tests

```bash
# All tests
npm run test:all

# Just React tests
npm run test

# Just Electron tests
npm run test:electron

# E2E tests (requires built app)
npm run test:e2e
```

### Writing Tests

- Unit tests go in `*.test.ts` files next to the source
- E2E tests go in `tests/specs/`
- Mock external dependencies
