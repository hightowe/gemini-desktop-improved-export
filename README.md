### 🚀 Quick Chat - Spotlight for Gemini

**Like macOS Spotlight, but for AI.** Press **`Ctrl+Shift+Space`** (or **`Cmd+Shift+Space`** on Mac) from anywhere—writing code, browsing, reading docs—and a floating command center appears instantly.

<!-- [INSERT QUICK CHAT SCREENSHOT HERE] -->

**What makes it powerful:**

- **🌟 Spotlight-Style Access** — Global hotkey summons Gemini over any app, just like `Cmd+Space` on Mac
- **💬 Floating Window** — Centered, always-on-top dialog that doesn't disrupt your workflow
- **⚡ Zero Friction** — Auto-focuses on input, submit your query, then it vanishes—results appear in your main Gemini chat
- **⌨️ Keyboard-First** — Type, submit with Enter, dismiss with Escape. No context switching required
- **🎯 Smart Positioning** — Appears on your active screen, keeps you in the flow

### 🕵️ Stealth Mode

Need to vanish? Press **`Ctrl+Alt+E`** (or **`Cmd+Alt+E`**) to instantly minimize the app to the system tray. Out of sight, out of mind, until you need it again.

### 📌 Always On Top

Keep Gemini visible while you work. Toggle "Always On Top" mode with **`Ctrl+Shift+T`** (or **`Cmd+Shift+T`**) so you can reference chats without switching windows.

## 🧪 Automated Testing

We take stability seriously. Gemini Desktop is backed by a comprehensive automated testing suite ensuring that core features work reliably and regressions are caught early.

### Our Strategy

- **Unit Tests**: Verify individual components and logic in isolation.
- **Integration Tests**: Ensure different parts of the system (Electron main process, renderer, localized APIs) work together smoothly.
- **End-to-End (E2E) Tests**: Simulate real user interactions—clicking, typing, and navigating—to validate full application flows.

### Running Tests

If you're contributing or just curious, you can run the full suite yourself:

```bash
# Run all tests (Unit, Integration, E2E)
npm run test:all

# Run only E2E tests
npm run test:e2e
```

We believe that a robust test suite is key to maintaining a high-quality experience.
