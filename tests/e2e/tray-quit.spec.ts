/**
 * E2E Test: Tray Quit Functionality
 *
 * Tests that the "Quit" menu item in the system tray properly exits the application.
 *
 * NOTE: This test intentionally causes the app to quit, which ends the WebDriver session.
 * We verify the quit was triggered by checking that clickTrayMenuItem('quit') executes without error.
 * The actual app termination is verified by the test framework detecting session end.
 *
 * Cross-platform: Windows, macOS, Linux

     * This test verifies that clicking "Quit" from the tray menu triggers app shutdown.
     *
     * APPROACH: After triggering quit, any WebDriver command will block until timeout.
     * Instead of trying to verify the window closed (which blocks), we:
     * 1. Verify tray exists and app is running
     * 2. Execute the quit action via trayManager.executeTrayAction('quit')
     * 3. Consider the test passed - the action was dispatched successfully
     *
     * The actual quit is verified by the logs showing "[TrayManager] Tray destroyed"
     * and "[MainWindow] Window closed" which appear in the test output.
